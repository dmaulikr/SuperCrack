# SuperCrack

SuperCrack! is a sleek, addictive code cracking game that has a unique Memory View which enables the player to record their assumptions as they progress. It's a challenging and fun game of deduction that requires the player to deduce a hidden code by reasoning about the feedback they receive after each move.

## Getting Started

Build and Run with Xcode 8.

## Tests

Run the tests with Command + U.

## Motivation

The author has always been a fan of code-cracking games and this one eliminates the need for pen and paper when cracking the code via the unique Memory View.
