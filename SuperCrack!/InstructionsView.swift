A move is made by pressing the numbered button for that row. Feedback will be given in that same area for each move made. The feedback consists of two numbers, the top number indicates how many in the move are correct colours but in an incorrect position and the bottom number shows how many in the move are both the correct colour and in the correct position. The feedback below therefore means that in that move, 3 colours are correct but in an incorrect position and there is 1 colour that is both the correct colour and in the correct position.")

A row is removed via the 'X' button on the left and has a handy button on the right to allow the player to mark how many of that colour they think the code contains. The 'UNDO' button allows the player to add back the last eliminated colour. In the current game, we already know there are 2 reds, 1 green and 1 purple:")

(the default), meaning the player doesn't know if that position contains that colour, a '\(cross)', indicating the player thinks that colour is not present in the code at that position, and a '\(tick)' to mean the player thinks that the colour exists in that position. The box at the bottom centre shows how many codes are possible (this never changes during the game) and how many are assumed, based on what is either marked as a '?' or a '\(tick)' in that column. If the player has reduced the problem to one possible code then the 'Assumed' box will show the number 1.")

The right side features a '? -> \(cross)' button which, for each column with a '\(tick)', makes the '?' buttons '\(cross)' buttons. This is useful when the player is sure a colour exists in that position as it saves them manually crossing off the '?'s in that column. The left side features a '\(tick)' button which will, on a column by column basis, hide the '?' and '\(cross)' buttons, useful for showing where the '\(tick)'s are as shown below.")

Once the player has a row of circles that they think might be the code, they may send that row directly to the Colour Board using the button on the left or send it down to another scrollable area below (which can contain many moves) using the button on the right. To remove a move from the lower area, press the '-' button to it's right. Note that the scrollable area at the bottom can also send a move directly to the Colour Board. Finally, the entire Memory View can be reset using the lower right reset button, clearing any assumptions the player has made about the game.")

The 'Number of Positions in the Code' controls how many positions are in the code, note that colours may be repeated. The 'Number of Colours' controls how many colours are used. These two parameters control how many possible codes there are, ranging from 256 possible codes with 4 positions and 4 colours to 262,144 possible codes with 6 positions and 8 colours. The third setting, 'Number of Moves' controls how many moves the player gets to discover the code. Good luck!")
